==================
Phase 4 — L4-04

'Explain it my way' adaptive lesson variant system.

Supported variant types (§6.4.1):
  - visual         : diagram-first, shapes/arrays/number lines, spatial explanations
  - story          : narrative framing, SA story context, characters solving real problems
  - step_by_step   : ultra-granular procedural breakdown, one micro-step per line
  - exam_style     : CAPS exam-format questions, marks allocated, formal phrasing
  - multilingual   : bilingual English/isiZulu or English/Afrikaans scaffolding

The variant_type is accepted by the lesson generator as an input parameter and
is forwarded to the Jinja2 prompt adapter in this module, which injects
variant-specific instructions into the lesson_generation_v1.jinja2 template.
