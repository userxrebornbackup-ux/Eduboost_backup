"""Role and RBAC policy definitions for V2 routers.

The persisted Guardian.role enum currently supports parent, teacher, and admin
(and student for learner/session contexts). Additional operational roles are
reserved here so policy code and documentation can converge before a database
migration introduces persisted assignments.
