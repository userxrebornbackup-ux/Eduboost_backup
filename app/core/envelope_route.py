"""
app/core/envelope_route.py
--------------------------
Provides ``EnvelopedRoute``, a custom ``APIRoute`` subclass that automatically
wraps any bare (non-enveloped) ``JSONResponse`` in the canonical
``ApiEnvelope`` format.

Usage — apply per-router (preferred, gives correct OpenAPI response_model):

    from fastapi import APIRouter
    from app.core.envelope_route import EnvelopedRoute

    router = APIRouter(route_class=EnvelopedRoute)

When ``route_class=EnvelopedRoute`` is set on a router, every endpoint that
returns a ``JSONResponse`` whose body is **not already an envelope** will be
wrapped transparently. This allows incremental migration: endpoints that
already call ``ok()`` / ``fail()`` / ``paginated()`` directly are unaffected
(the wrapper detects the envelope structure and passes them through).

Design notes
------------
* Request-ID is read from ``request.state.request_id`` (set by the request-ID
  middleware upstream) and injected into the envelope ``meta`` field.
* The ``api_version`` field is always ``"v2"``.
* HTTP status codes are preserved.
* Only ``JSONResponse`` bodies are touched; ``StreamingResponse`` and others
  are passed through unchanged.
* The wrapper never swallows exceptions — errors still propagate to
  ``app/core/exceptions.py`` handlers.
