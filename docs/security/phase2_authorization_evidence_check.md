# Phase 2 Authorization Evidence Check

## Purpose

This check consolidates the Phase 2 authorization evidence created so far.

It verifies that the authorization policy, dependency adapter, enforced pilot
routes, HTTP tests, and documentation are present and wired.

## Command

```bash
make phase2-authz-check
```

Equivalent direct command:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_phase2_authorization_evidence.py
```

## Non-Goal

This check does not claim all Phase 2 authorization work is complete. It is an
evidence gate for the endpoints already migrated.
