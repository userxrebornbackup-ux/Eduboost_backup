# Phase 2 Authorization Closure Report

## Scope

Phase 2 covers learner-object authorization for learner-owned data routes,
plus explicit authentication-boundary documentation for catalog or operational
routes that do not carry a learner object.

## Route Matrix Summary

- Routes inspected: 71
- Covered learner-scoped routes: 50
- Non-learner-scoped routes: 19
- Missing learner authorization markers: 2

## Key Evidence

- `docs/security/object_authorization.md` — present
- `docs/security/authorization_dependencies.md` — present
- `docs/security/learner_authz_matrix.md` — present
- `docs/security/learner_authz_coverage_check.md` — present
- `docs/security/learner_authz_ci.md` — present
- `docs/security/phase2_authorization_evidence_check.md` — present

## Verification Commands

```bash
make runtime-check
make openapi-check
make route-inventory-check
make pr002r-check
make phase2-authz-check
make learner-authz-check
pytest -c pytest.ini tests/unit/test_phase2_authorization_evidence.py tests/unit/test_check_learner_authz_coverage.py tests/unit/test_phase2_router_import_smoke.py -q --no-cov
```

## Operational Auth Boundary Hardening

Operational routes that do not carry a learner object are documented
separately from learner-object authorization. These files define the
non-production, admin-only, or authenticated-user boundary for each
exception class:

- `docs/security/dev_session_environment_gate.md` — present
- `docs/security/consent_renewal_admin_auth_boundary.md` — present
- `docs/security/ether_onboarding_questions_auth_boundary.md` — present

Operational boundary hardening stamp: operational exceptions are explicit
and remain covered by Phase 2 evidence checks.

## Closure Status

Status: **not closed** — missing learner authorization markers remain.

- `auth.py` `POST /dev-session` via `create_dev_session`
- `gamification.py` `GET /leaderboard` via `get_leaderboard`

## Closure Stamp

Phase 2 closure evidence is anchored by `make phase2-authz-closure`,
`make learner-authz-check`, and `make phase2-authz-check`.
