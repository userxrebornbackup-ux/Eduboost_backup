# Final Release Evidence Ledger

## Purpose

The final release evidence ledger is the canonical ledger for the completed controlled staging/beta release evidence package.

## Required Ledger Sections

- release identity
- release readiness
- release governance
- terminal closure
- post-terminal audit readiness
- release-owner handoff
- release-owner decision
- merge signoff
- no-op execution boundary
- archive completeness
- checksum index
- final project closeout

- `docs/operations/beta_release_final_index.md`

## Ledger Rules

- ledger must reference release candidate and commit SHA
- ledger must preserve controlled staging/beta scope
- ledger must preserve release-owner decision references
- ledger must preserve manual approval workflow references
- ledger must preserve no-op execution boundary references
- ledger must preserve archive and checksum references
- ledger must not authorize unrestricted production launch

## Boundary

This final release evidence ledger records evidence traceability only. It does not approve production launch, execute deployment, create release tags, or replace manual approval.

## Command

```bash
make final-release-evidence-ledger-check
```
