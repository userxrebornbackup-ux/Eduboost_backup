- archive must reference release candidate and commit SHA
- archive must preserve accepted, rejected, deferred, or rolled back outcome
- archive must preserve feedback and known issue summaries
- archive must preserve unresolved follow-up ownership
- archive must preserve support and incident trigger references
- archive must not include unnecessary learner personal information
- archive must remain audit evidence, not production launch authorization

## Boundary

This archive manifest preserves evidence. It does not approve release, execute deployment, create release tags, or replace source control history.
