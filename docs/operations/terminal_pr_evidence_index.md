## Terminal PR Rules

- terminal PR index must reference release candidate and commit SHA
- terminal PR index must reference branch and PR number
- terminal PR index must preserve sealed reviewer closeout packet references
- terminal PR index must preserve final audit handoff register references
- terminal PR index must preserve terminal evidence seal references
- terminal PR index must preserve no-op execution boundary references
- terminal PR index must remain controlled staging/beta evidence

## Boundary

This terminal PR evidence index records PR evidence navigation only. It does not approve production launch, execute deployment, create release tags, or merge the pull request automatically.

make terminal-pr-evidence-index-check
```
