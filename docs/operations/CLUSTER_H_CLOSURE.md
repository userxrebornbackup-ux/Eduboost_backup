# Cluster H Staging and Beta Release Closure

## Scope

Cluster H establishes final staging and beta-release evidence for controlled
release readiness, sign-off, rollback, post-deploy smoke verification, approval
workflow, release candidate tagging, and evidence bundle indexing.

## Closure Commands

```bash
make staging-smoke-evidence-manifest
make beta-signoff-manifest
make beta-release-evidence-bundle
make release-candidate-tag-manifest
make beta-release-readiness-contract-check
make staging-smoke-evidence-manifest-check
make beta-signoff-manifest-check
make beta-release-evidence-bundle-check
make beta-rollback-runbook-check
make post-deploy-staging-smoke-checklist-check
make release-approval-workflow-contract-check
make release-candidate-tag-manifest-check
make cluster-h-release-readiness-check
make cluster-h-closure-check
```

## Closure Boundary

Cluster H closure means the evidence and operational gates for staging/beta are
defined and CI-checkable. It does not authorize unrestricted production launch.

## Closure Stamp

Cluster H is first-pass closed when `make cluster-h-closure-check` passes.
