# Final Reviewer Pack Checklist

## Purpose

The final reviewer pack checklist defines the minimum review sequence for the completed controlled staging/beta release evidence package.

## Required Reviewer Inputs

- final release evidence table of contents
- final acceptance packet index
- PR-ready final closure certificate
- archival lock assertion
- release handoff freeze assertion
- post-closeout evidence access policy
- final release evidence ledger
- final evidence no-op execution assertion
- final merge signoff lock
- release owner post-closeout decision record

## Reviewer Checks

- reviewer verifies release candidate and commit SHA consistency

- reviewer verifies no-op execution boundary is present
- reviewer verifies manual approval workflow references are preserved
- reviewer verifies branch and PR references are present
