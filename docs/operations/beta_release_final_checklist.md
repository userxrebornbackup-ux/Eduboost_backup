## Required Pre-Approval Checks

- branch is rebased on remote target branch
- OpenAPI drift check passes
- staging release gate check passes
- release evidence artifacts check passes
- Cluster C POPIA consent closure check passes
- Cluster D deployment closure check passes
- Cluster E data resilience closure check passes
- Cluster F AI safety closure check passes
- Cluster G frontend journey closure check passes
- Cluster H closure check passes

## Required Generated Evidence

## Required Manual Confirmations
