# Service Boundary Classification Policy

**Status:** active

## Rule

Do not delete `app/services/` wholesale. After the P0 runtime repairs, that package contains active cross-cutting runtime facades and authorization helpers.

## Classifications

| Classification | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `active_runtime_facade` | Runtime helper or facade used by repaired routers/services | Keep |
| `authorization_helper` | Cross-cutting authz helper | Keep or move deliberately |
| `canonical_domain_service` | Current domain service implementation | Keep |
| `deprecated_legacy_service` | Old implementation pending call-site removal | Migrate/delete after proof |
| `migration_or_compat_helper` | Transitional adapter/helper | Keep until migration complete |
| `duplicate_domain_service` | Competing domain implementation | Resolve in targeted refactor |
| `unclassified` | Needs manual classification | Review |

## Enforcement

Repaired P0 routers must not import `app.repositories` directly. New router repository imports must go through service/dependency layers unless explicitly allowlisted with a dated migration note.
