# Boundary Enforcement Policy

**Status:** active for repaired P0 routers

## Rule

FastAPI routers must orchestrate request/response concerns. They must not construct repositories directly in repaired P0 domains.

## Current strict targets

- `app/api_v2_routers/popia.py`
- `app/api_v2_routers/lessons.py`

## Transitional allowance

`app/api_v2_routers/auth.py` may retain limited learner repository access until the auth service extraction batch fully centralizes register/login/refresh behavior.

## Next expansion

After auth service extraction, this policy should be extended to every v2 router and enforced by import-linter in CI.
