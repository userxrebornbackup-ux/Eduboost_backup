# DOC-22: Quality Metrics Report (QMR)
**MIL-STD-498**

## 1. Executive Summary
This Quality Metrics Report (QMR) provides a comprehensive analysis of software quality metrics for EduBoost V2 Release 1.0.0, tracking progress against targets throughout the development lifecycle.

**Report Period:** April 1 — May 10, 2026  
**Overall Quality Score:** Historical snapshot; requires re-baselining before release  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION HEALTHY - NOT PRODUCTION READY
**Total Commits This Period:** 20+ commits across 6 phases
**Total Project Tasks:** Historical metric; no longer authoritative for release readiness

> Current-state note (2026-05-10): this report is retained as a historical
> quality snapshot. It must not be used as production-release evidence. The
> active project status is tracked in [`docs/project_status.md`](../../project_status.md).

```
Current:      82%
Trend:        +3% per week (slowing)
Projection:   85% by release (May 15)
Target:       80%
Confidence:   95%
```

### 9.2 Projected Defect Discovery
```
Defects Discovered:  62 (to date)
Defects Fixed:       60 (97%)
Remaining:           2 (acceptable risk)
Projection:          0 critical defects at release
```

## 10. Quality Recommendations

### 10.1 Immediate Actions (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Optimize cache p95 latency (goal: <45ms)
- [ ] Review 2 deferred minor issues (decide: fix or waive)
- [ ] Final security audit pre-release
- [ ] Load test with 100 concurrent users

### 10.2 Post-Release Actions
- Monitor production metrics (daily)
- Track real-world cache hit ratio
- Alert on LLM cost spike (>$0.012)
- Incident response drill (quarterly)

### 10.3 Medium-term Improvements
- Increase code coverage to 85% (Q2 2026)
- Implement performance profiling (Q2 2026)
- Achieve zero known CVEs (Q3 2026)
- Complete security certification (Q4 2026)

## 11. Conclusion
EduBoost V2 demonstrates useful quality progress across code, testing, security,
and performance dimensions, but this historical report does not prove production
readiness. Current release blockers remain documented in
[`docs/project_status.md`](../../project_status.md), including item-bank content
expansion to the 120 approved Grade 4 Mathematics items required for launch.

**Overall Assessment: NOT READY FOR RELEASE - HISTORICAL QUALITY SNAPSHOT**
