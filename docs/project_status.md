# Project Status

This page is a project-status index. The canonical current-state source of truth is docs/current_state.md, which is generated from live checks by scripts/refresh_current_state_doc.py.

## Current Verified Baseline

EduBoost V2 is in a release-candidate hardening phase, not a release-ready or public-beta-ready phase.

The latest local refresh on 2026-05-17 assessed commit 859695dac818 and reports RED quality status: 9 of 11 required checks passed. The live API contract checks now pass after regenerating docs/openapi.json and docs/route_inventory.md, but two required gates remain open:

- Architecture import boundaries fail. Import Linter now runs against the actual V2 packages and exposes real boundary violations between routers, modules, services, repositories, domain, and core.
- Backend unit gate did not complete inside the 300-second current-state timeout. The previous documented 1702 passed, 29 skipped result is historical until a fresh run is captured.

Recently reconciled checks that now agree with the live runtime:

- app.api_v2:app imports successfully.
- OpenAPI drift check passes.
- Route inventory drift check passes.
- Frontend lint, type-check, and Vitest unit checks pass.
- PR-002R evidence, E2E opt-in workflow, Makefile deduplication, staging release gate, and POPIA legal evidence checks pass locally.

## Release Readiness

Status: blocked. Do not describe the repository as production-ready, release-ready, or public-beta-ready until docs/current_state.md is green and the release evidence bundle has current CI, staging, backup, restore, rollback, branch-protection, and sign-off evidence.

The root TODO.md remains the North Star tracker for work that is implemented but still needs CI, runtime, external, legal, security, product, or beta-launch proof.

## Claim Discipline

Do not describe the repository as production-ready until the release-blocker checklist is complete.

Claims must be phrased according to evidence:

| Claim type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| implemented | Source code exists. |
| tested | Targeted tests pass locally or in CI. |
| CI verified | Required workflow passed on the relevant branch or PR. |
| staging verified | Evidence exists from the staging environment. |
| production verified | Evidence exists from the production environment. |
| planned | Work is accepted but not implemented. |
| blocked | Work cannot proceed without an explicit blocker being resolved. |

## Compatibility Boundary

EduBoost is V2-first, but not every historical surface has disappeared:

- Archived legacy code is kept under app/legacy.
- app.legacy.api.main:app is retained as a compatibility shim.
- The legacy shim may expose a 410 Gone response for /api/v1/lessons/generate when explicitly imported.
- The canonical production runtime remains app.api_v2:app.
- Legacy compatibility routes must not appear in the canonical V2 OpenAPI schema.

## Remaining Release Blockers

Current blockers are evidence-backed, not inferred:

- [ ] Resolve architecture import-boundary violations or deliberately revise the contracts with documented rationale.
- [ ] Capture a fresh full backend unit-suite result outside the 300-second current-state timeout.
- [ ] Capture authoritative remote CI evidence for the target branch.
- [ ] Verify branch protection and required checks.
- [ ] Execute and capture staging smoke evidence against a real deployed environment.
- [ ] Execute and capture backup, restore, and rollback drill evidence.
- [ ] Complete external legal/security/product sign-offs before real learner data or public beta.
- [ ] Resolve the CAPS content gate: current approved item count is below beta and production thresholds.

## Production-readiness implementation phase

EduBoost V2 remains in a production-readiness implementation phase: repository-side evidence is present, while runtime, legal, security, deployment, and human approval gates remain separate.
