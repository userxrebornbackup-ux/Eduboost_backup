## Route findings

| Route function | Line | Delegate calls | Direct DB mutations | Status |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `grant_consent` | 102 | `consent_svc.grant` | `-` | `route-delegates-to-service-boundary` |
| `deny_consent` | 120 | `consent_svc.deny` | `-` | `route-delegates-to-service-boundary` |

## Transaction service markers found

- `.begin()`
- `TransactionalPOPIA`
- `TransactionalPOPIAConsentLifecycleService`

## Blockers

- live-db: Live DB evidence URL is pending
- live-db: Test result is pending
- live-db: Database is pending
- live-db: Commit SHA is pending
- live-db: Verified by is pending
- live-db: Date verified is pending
- live-db: Live DB evidence URL must be a URL
- live-db: Test result must be passed/pass/green/ok
- live-db: Commit SHA must look like a git SHA

## No false-closure rules

- POPIA route delegation does not prove live database rollback.
- Service markers do not prove the production route path by themselves.
- ROUTE-TX-POPIA-001 release mode requires live DB evidence.
- TX-ROUTE-001 remains open until all mutation route slices are wired and proven.

## Interpretation

This report proves only the local POPIA route delegation slice. It does not prove live database rollback.
