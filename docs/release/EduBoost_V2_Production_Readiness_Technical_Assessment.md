# EduBoost V2 — Production Readiness Technical Assessment

**Assessment date:** 2026-05-13  
**Assessment basis:** Uploaded repository ZIP: `Eduboost-V2-master(1).zip`  
**Assessment type:** Repository-side technical assessment, not live deployment certification.

## 1. Executive technical status

EduBoost V2 is now in a strong **repository-side production-readiness baseline** state.

Correct classification:

> Repository-side production-readiness evidence completed; runtime, external, legal, security, deployment, and human approval gates remain outstanding.

This is **not** production launch approval.

| Dimension | Status |
|---|---|
| Repository evidence baseline | Strong / substantially complete |
| Domain coverage 00–20 | Broadly complete |
| Deterministic readiness scripts | Primary checks pass |
| Documentation / ADR posture | Strong, with some naming/link drift |
| Runtime production readiness | Not yet proven |
| External/manual verification | Pending |
| Legal/privacy approval | Pending |
| Deployment environment verification | Pending |
| Final launch state | No-go for production launch until external/manual/runtime checks pass |
| Beta/staging readiness posture | Near-ready for controlled staging/beta verification |

## 2. Production-readiness domain coverage: 00–20

The repository contains all 21 production-readiness backlog files:

## 3. Actual implementation vs evidence-only

The repository contains both implementation modules and repository-side readiness contract modules.

### Actual implementation surface

Examples:

```text
app/modules/auth/
app/modules/consent/
app/modules/diagnostics/
app/modules/lessons/
app/modules/practice/
app/modules/progress/
app/modules/learners/
app/modules/parent_portal/
app/modules/rlhf/
```

These represent application/domain logic.

### Repository-side readiness contract surface

Examples:

```text
app/modules/billing/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/notifications/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/observability/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/deployment/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/disaster_recovery/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/quality_gates/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/security_posture/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/operations_support/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/documentation_governance/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/beta_launch/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/roadmap/production_readiness_contracts.py
app/modules/final_release_blockers/production_readiness_contracts.py
```

These are valuable governance and readiness contracts. They are not live provider integrations.

| Area | Current state |
|---|---|
| Billing | Contract/evidence exists. Live payment provider integration remains external/future. |
| Notifications | Contract/evidence exists. Live email/SMS/WhatsApp/push setup remains external/future. |
| Observability | Contract/evidence exists. Live telemetry backend and dashboard verification remain external/future. |
| Backup/restore | Contract/evidence exists. Actual restore drill execution remains external/future. |
| Deployment | Contract/evidence exists. Actual staging/prod deployment verification remains external/future. |
| Final release blockers | Contract/evidence exists. Human/legal/security/deployment approval remains external/future. |

## 4. Test and verification surface

Primary production-readiness checks were inspected/executed and passed for the main 05–20 domains and earlier primary domains.

Representative passing scripts:

```text
scripts/check_database_persistence_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_ai_llm_safety_caps_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_diagnostics_assessment_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_frontend_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_billing_monetization_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_notifications_communication_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_observability_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_ci_cd_deployment_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_backup_restore_disaster_recovery_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_testing_release_quality_gates_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_security_posture_threat_modeling_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_incident_response_operations_support_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_documentation_adrs_claim_discipline_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_beta_launch_staging_acceptance_production_readiness.py
scripts/check_roadmap_after_production_readiness_baseline.py
scripts/check_final_release_blocker_checklist.py
```

### Pytest limitation during assessment

Full pytest execution was not completed in the sandbox because `sqlalchemy` was not installed in the sandbox runtime. The repo requirements include SQLAlchemy, so this appears to be an environment bootstrap issue rather than a repository defect.

Recommended local validation:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -c pytest.ini tests/unit -q --no-cov
```

## 5. Makefile and check-script consistency

The Makefile contains readiness targets for the added domains. Primary check-script naming is generally consistent for 05–20.

### Main issue: duplicate/stale domain wrappers

There are duplicate numbered domain wrapper scripts for domains 09–14, including:

```text
check_domain_09_billing_monetization_evidence.py
check_domain_09_testing_quality_evidence.py
check_domain_10_notifications_communication_evidence.py
check_domain_10_observability_monitoring_evidence.py
check_domain_11_billing_payments_evidence.py
check_domain_11_observability_evidence.py
check_domain_12_ci_cd_deployment_evidence.py
check_domain_12_notifications_communication_evidence.py
check_domain_13_backup_restore_disaster_recovery_evidence.py
check_domain_13_infrastructure_devops_evidence.py
check_domain_14_legal_privacy_documentation_evidence.py
check_domain_14_testing_release_quality_gates_evidence.py
```

One legacy/stale script fails:

```text
scripts/check_domain_09_testing_quality_evidence.py
```

It expects:

```text
.github/workflows/frontend-e2e-opt-in.yml
```

but the repo has:

```text
.github/workflows/frontend-e2e.yml
```

The new domain 14 quality-gate path passes. The stale script is a repository hygiene risk.

## 6. Documentation and ADR posture

The documentation posture is strong. The repo contains a large evidence corpus and ADR layer covering billing, notifications, observability, deployment, DR, quality gates, security, incident response, documentation governance, beta launch, roadmap governance, and final release blockers.

### Strengths

- Strong separation between repository evidence and live/manual approval.
- ADRs preserve major architectural decisions.
- Claim-discipline layer prevents overstating production readiness.
- Release-blocker layer explicitly tracks external/manual dependencies.

### Issues found

#### A. Root TODO domain 01 link drift

`TODO.md` links domain 01 using an em dash filename, but the actual filename uses `#U2014`.

Actual file:

```text
docs/backlog/production_readiness/01_pr-002r_replacement_#U2014_backend_runtime_and_api_contract_baseline.md
```

#### B. Root TODO is an index, not completion ledger

`TODO.md` still reads like a backlog index. It should be updated to distinguish:

```text
repository-side evidence complete
manual/external/runtime verification pending
```

#### C. Raw unchecked items remain

Some backlog docs still contain raw unchecked items:

```text
00: 30 unchecked
01: 64 unchecked
02: 48 unchecked
03: 12 unchecked
04: 98 unchecked
20: 34 unchecked
```

These may be legal/manual/external/runtime items, but they should be reclassified to avoid ambiguity.

## 7. Security, privacy, and POPIA posture

The repo now has mature repository-side security and privacy evidence:

```text
POPIA consent
data-subject rights
audit evidence
security posture
threat modeling
secret hygiene
supply-chain security
risk acceptance
incident response
privacy escalation
claim discipline
```

Remaining security/privacy blockers:

```text
formal legal review
formal POPIA/privacy officer signoff
security officer signoff
penetration test
live secret scanning enforcement
live cloud IAM review
live production security headers
live telemetry redaction verification
live incident process rehearsal
```

Assessment:

> Security/privacy posture is strong as a repository baseline, but not externally attested.

## 8. Deployment and runtime readiness gaps

The repository includes deployment-oriented evidence and assets:

```text
docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.prod.yml
k8s/
bicep/
prometheus/
grafana/
alertmanager/
deployment/
staging/
```

Remaining runtime gaps:

```text
staging environment exists and is healthy
production environment exists and is healthy
real DATABASE_URL / REDIS_URL / secrets are configured
migrations run cleanly against staging/prod
containers build and run in target environment
staging smoke tests pass against deployed services
TLS/CORS/security headers are correct in live environment
Prometheus/Grafana/alert routes are live
backup jobs run on schedule
restore drill has been performed
rollback has been tested
```

Assessment:

> Deployment readiness is well specified, but not runtime-proven.

## 9. External/manual blockers

Key external/manual areas:

```text
GitHub branch protection and repository settings
human release-owner signoff
legal/privacy approval
security approval
live payment provider setup
live notification provider setup
live telemetry backend setup
cloud infrastructure configuration
production deployment execution
beta participant enrollment
```

Recommended external verification checklist:

```text
1. GitHub branch protection verified.
2. Required CI checks enforced.
3. CODEOWNERS review rules verified.
4. Secrets configured in target environment.
5. Staging deployment executed.
6. Staging smoke tests passed.
7. POPIA/legal review completed.
8. Security review completed.
9. Support channel tested.
10. Incident escalation path tested.
11. Backup dry-run and restore drill performed.
12. Final beta launch signoff recorded.
```

## 10. Codebase architecture risks

### A. Evidence layer may outpace implementation layer

Readiness contracts must not be confused for runtime integrations.

Examples:

```text
billing contracts != live billing
notification contracts != live notification delivery
observability contracts != live dashboards
DR contracts != actual restore drill
final release blocker checklist != launch approval
```

### B. Historical domain numbering drift

Duplicate domain wrappers create a CI/release-operator risk.

### C. TODO/backlog completion semantics are ambiguous

Raw `[ ]` items in completed backlog areas can make the repo look unfinished even where the remaining work is manual/external.

### D. Environment bootstrap should be explicit

The repo should expose a clear one-command validation path:

```text
make bootstrap-dev
make test-readiness
make production-readiness-all
```

## 11. Remaining release blockers

### Repository hygiene blockers

| Blocker | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|---:|---|
| Stale failing `check_domain_09_testing_quality_evidence.py` | Medium | Update or retire it. |
| Broken root TODO link for domain 01 | Low/Medium | Fix filename reference. |
| Remaining raw `[ ]` checklist items in 00–04 and 20 | Medium | Reclassify as manual/external/legal/runtime. |
| Duplicate domain numbering scripts | Medium | Canonicalize domain wrappers. |

### Runtime blockers

| Blocker | Severity |
|---|---:|
| No verified staging deployment evidence in the ZIP | High |
| No live migration run evidence | High |
| No live observability/dashboard evidence | High |
| No live backup/restore drill evidence | High |
| No live provider verification for billing/notifications | Medium/High |
| No actual full pytest/CI result artifact included | Medium/High |

### Human/external blockers

| Blocker | Severity |
|---|---:|
| Legal/POPIA signoff pending | Release blocker |
| Security signoff / penetration test pending | Release blocker |
| Release-owner final approval pending | Release blocker |
| GitHub branch protection verification pending | High |
| Production deployment approval pending | Release blocker |

6. Decide GA roadmap from evidence.
```

## 13. Final go/no-go classification

| Target | Classification | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Repository-side production-readiness baseline | GO | Evidence baseline is broad, coherent, and mostly self-verifying. |
| Controlled staging verification | GO, with cleanup recommended first | Cleanup stale wrappers/TODO/checklist semantics first. |
| Controlled private beta | CONDITIONAL GO | Requires staging, smoke/E2E, legal, security, support, known-issues, cohort, and release-owner signoff. |
| Public beta | NO-GO | Runtime and external approval evidence not yet present. |
| Production launch | NO-GO | Legal/security/deployment/manual approvals and runtime evidence are not yet present. |

## Bottom line

EduBoost V2 has moved from a backlog-heavy state to a well-instrumented repository-side production-readiness baseline. The next phase is not more repository evidence. The next phase is execution evidence:

```text
clean CI run
staging deployment
runtime smoke tests
legal/security/support signoff
restore drill
final beta go/no-go
```

The repo is ready for a serious staging/beta-readiness validation cycle. It is not yet ready to be described as production-launched or externally approved.
