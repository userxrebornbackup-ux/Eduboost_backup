- Selected route count: `3`

## Route findings

| Route function | Line | Delegate calls | Direct DB mutations | Status |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `submit_diagnostic` | 81 | `-` | `-` | `not-proven` |
| `start_diagnostic_session` | 229 | `service.start_session` | `-` | `route-delegates-to-service-boundary` |
| `diagnostic_respond` | 293 | `session_service.recover_session, session_service.submit_response` | `-` | `route-delegates-to-service-boundary` |

## Transaction service markers found

- `.begin()`
- `TransactionalDiagnostic`
- `TransactionalDiagnosticResponseService`
- `async with self.session.begin`

## Blockers

- submit_diagnostic: no diagnostics service delegate call found
- live-db: Live DB evidence URL is pending
- live-db: Test result is pending
- live-db: Database is pending
- live-db: Commit SHA is pending
- live-db: Verified by is pending
- live-db: Date verified is pending
- live-db: Live DB evidence URL must be a URL
- live-db: Test result must be passed/pass/green/ok
- live-db: Commit SHA must look like a git SHA

## No false-closure rules

- Diagnostics route delegation does not prove live database rollback.
- Service markers do not prove the production route path by themselves.
- ROUTE-TX-DIAG-001 release mode requires local source passing plus live DB evidence.
- TX-ROUTE-001 remains open until all mutation route slices are wired and proven.

## Interpretation

This report proves only the local diagnostics route delegation slice when local status is passing. It does not prove live database rollback.
