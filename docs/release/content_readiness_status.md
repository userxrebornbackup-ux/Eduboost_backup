## Boundary

This clears the content gate for the Grade 4 Mathematics launch slice only. It does not clear CI, branch protection, backup and restore, legal or security signoff, frontend journey evidence, or formal beta go-no-go.

## Content Factory Refreshed Plan Integration

Status: repository-side foundation implemented and locally tested on branch `feature/content-factory-refreshed`; not yet CI, staging, educator-review, or production verified.

The refreshed Content Factory implementation adds ETL-backed provenance gates, generated-artifact lifecycle tables, admin validation/review routes, and the `/admin/content-factory` dashboard entry point. Evidence: `docs/release/content_factory_refreshed_status.md`.

This improves the future content expansion path but does not change the launch-slice boundary above or replace external educator/content approval.
