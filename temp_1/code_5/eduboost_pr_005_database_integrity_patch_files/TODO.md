# 0. Production Definition of Done

## 0.1 Non-negotiable production gate

- [x] `[critical]` Publish a first tagged release, e.g. `v0.1.0-beta`, only after all mandatory CI jobs pass on the canonical production branch.
- [x] `[critical]` Confirm the release workflow blocks production promotion unless the following pass: backend lint, backend type check, backend unit tests, backend integration tests, Alembic schema drift check, POPIA compliance tests, frontend tests, frontend type check, frontend build, Playwright E2E tests, Docker image scan, dependency audit, secret scan, and staging smoke tests.
- [x] `[critical]` Generate a release evidence bundle containing backend image digest, frontend build/image digest, migration revision, changelog entry, SBOM, test reports, coverage reports, security scan reports, and deployment manifest.
- [x] `[critical]` Add `docs/release_checklist.md` and require it for every tagged release.
- [x] `[critical]` Define production launch scope precisely: supported grades, supported subjects, supported lesson types, supported diagnostic flows, supported languages, supported payment modes, and unsupported features.
- [x] `[critical]` Avoid claiming full CAPS coverage until every claimed topic has validated lessons, diagnostic items, answer keys, and review status.

## 0.2 Health, readiness, and runtime acceptance

- [x] `[critical]` `/health` returns `200` when the API process is alive.
- [x] `[critical]` `/ready` returns `200` only when PostgreSQL, Redis, migrations, audit repository, critical secrets, and core background-job dependencies are available.
- [x] `[critical]` `/ready` returns `503` with structured non-sensitive diagnostics when dependencies are unavailable.

# 1. Repository Governance and Hygiene

## 1.1 Canonical source of truth

- [x] `[critical]` Decide and document the canonical repository: `NkgoloL/Eduboost-V2`, `w3ll3ml3b3lo-hue/Eduboost-V2`, or another private/public upstream. Evidence: `docs/repository_governance.md` documents `NkgoloL/Eduboost-V2` as canonical for this snapshot and defines mirror/fork promotion rules.
- [x] `[critical]` Add `docs/repository_governance.md` covering canonical repo, mirrors, branch policy, release authority, secret rotation authority, security patch process, and archive policy. Evidence: `docs/repository_governance.md` expanded with canonical upstream, mirrors, branch protection requirements, release authority, secret rotation authority, security patch process, archive policy, and governance change control.
- [ ] `[high]` Protect `master`/`main`: require PR review, required checks, no force-push, no branch deletion, and signed commits if feasible. Repository-side evidence added in `docs/repository_governance.md`; final enforcement must be configured in GitHub branch/ruleset settings.
- [x] `[high]` Add `CODEOWNERS` for backend, frontend, infrastructure, security, compliance, curriculum, and docs. Evidence: `.github/CODEOWNERS` covers backend, frontend, infrastructure, security/privacy/compliance, curriculum/AI, docs, dependencies, tests, and workflows.

## 1.2 Dependency and artifact cleanup

- [x] `[high]` Audit dependency files and decide canonical dependency paths for runtime, dev, docs, and ML extras. Evidence: `docs/dependency_management.md` defines canonical `requirements/*.in` and `requirements/*.txt` paths; root `requirements*.txt` files are explicit compatibility aliases.
- [x] `[high]` Remove duplicate or stale root dependency files, or clearly mark them as compatibility aliases. Evidence: root `requirements*.txt` files now contain explicit compatibility-alias comments and include canonical files under `requirements/`.
- [x] `[high]` Enable Dependabot or Renovate for Python, npm, Docker images, and GitHub Actions. Evidence: `.github/dependabot.yml` covers pip, npm frontend, GitHub Actions, and Docker ecosystems.
- [x] `[medium]` Add a `Makefile` or `justfile` with commands: `dev`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `e2e`, `migrate`, `docs`, `security`, `release-check`, and `smoke`. Evidence: `Makefile` now exposes all required targets.
- [x] `[medium]` Add `docs/adr/` and write ADRs for modular monolith, FastAPI V2, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL audit ledger, Redis revocation, LLM provider abstraction, POPIA-first design, and CAPS alignment. Evidence: `docs/adr/0001` through `0009` cover the required decisions and `docs/adr/README.md` indexes them.
- [x] `[medium]` Add markdown linting and docs link checking to CI. Evidence: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` includes Markdown linting plus a dedicated `docs-quality` job using `lycheeverse/lychee-action` for link checks.

- [ ] `[high]` Decide canonical business-logic location: either `app/services` as application layer or `app/modules/<context>/service.py` as bounded-context services.
- [ ] `[high]` Remove metaphor-layer ambiguity from active code: `ether`, `judiciary`, `fourth_estate`, and `executive` should not be core engineering boundaries.
- [ ] `[medium]` Keep metaphor names only for storytelling/docs if useful; use domain names in code.

# 29. Strategic Product Direction

EduBoost should position itself as:

> **A privacy-first, CAPS-aligned adaptive learning platform for South African primary learners, combining diagnostic precision, AI-assisted remediation, parent visibility, and low-bandwidth accessibility.**

The defensible advantage is not simply “AI lessons.” The moat should be:

1. Consent-safe learner data handling.
2. CAPS-grounded content and diagnostics.
3. Adaptive remediation from measured learning gaps.
4. Parent and teacher visibility.
5. South African languages, context, and infrastructure realism.
6. Transparent AI with validation, review, and accountability.

Build toward that, and EduBoost becomes more than another education app. It becomes trustworthy localized learning infrastructure.

## Notes

- This tracker replaces the earlier stale TODO that described a different and
  much older migration state.
- The comparative audit raised several issues that are already obsolete in the
  current working repository; those are marked `[done]` above so they remain
  visible without pretending they still need action.
